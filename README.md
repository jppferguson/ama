# Ask Me Anything!

A repository to ask @jppferguson anything. Largely ~~stolen~~ inspired by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman) and [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

I'm a kiwi, currently living in the UK and I've been working in digital agencies for the past decade. I'm a sucker for coffee, craft beer, clean design, the latest tech and travelling. If there's something you want to know about me, or you just want to pick my brains then this is the place.


## [Ask a question](../../issues/new)
Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](../../issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry — if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.


## [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

Check out the [Closed Issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past.


### Guidelines

- Please ensure your question hasn't already [been answered](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Lastly, be cool.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just hit me up on Twitter. 140 characters makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@jppferguson](https://twitter.com/jppferguson) on Twitter (and pretty much everywhere else online).

### Create your own

If you'd like to create your own AMA repository:

- Click `Fork` at the top of this page, or copy/paste its [readme](../../blob/master/README.md) into a new repo.
- Edit the README & personalise to your flavour
- If you forked this repo, you will have to enable the issue tracker: `Settings` → `Features` → `☑ Issues`.
